should make the autoincremented values available on the returned instances
should make the autoincremented values available on the returned instances with custom fields
is possible to use functions as default values
doesn't allow case-insensitive duplicated records using CITEXT
allows the creation of a TSVECTOR field
TSVECTOR only allow string
doesn't allow duplicated records with unique function based indexes
sets auto increment fields
should return autoIncrement primary key \(create\)
several concurrent calls
should error correctly when defaults contain a unique key and the where clause is complex
should work with multiple concurrent calls
should not deadlock with concurrency duplicate entries and no outer transaction
