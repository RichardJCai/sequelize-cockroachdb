# sequelize-cockroachdb

[This NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize-cockroachdb) makes Sequelize compatible with CockroachDB.

Please file bugs against the [sequelize-cockroachdb project](https://github.com/cockroachdb/sequelize-cockroachdb/issues/new)

## Limitations

CockroachDB does not support `ENUM` types, so using `Sequelize.ENUM`s with
CockroachDB will be backed by `TEXT` fields. This means that there will be no
database-level assurance that the fields are valid (though Sequelize itself
will validate values if `typeValidation` is enabled).
